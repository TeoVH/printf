## Formatted Printing Function

### Header file
#### int printf(const char *format, ...)
The printf() function prints output to STDOUT, according to format and
other arguments passed to printf(). The string format consists of two
types of items - characters that will be printed to the screen, and
format commands that define how the other arguments to printf() are
displayed. Basically, you specify a format string that has text in it,
as well as "special" characters that map to the other arguments of
printf(). For example, this code
- Formats and prints its arguments as specified by the format string.
- Plain characters in format are simply copied.
- Format specifications are made up of a the percent sign (%) followed by one of the following conversion
operators, which determine what printf does with its arguments:
% - print a single % character
